% This can be called for a particular macro with something like
% -jobname=cJamesBond by defining \thing to a macro based on jobname.
% If the second character of jobname is not uppercase, we
% define \thing to expand to every PC because that probably means
% jobname is not overridden.  Alternately, you can select the run with
% -jobname=1 or -jobname=1-cJamesBond.  \GAMERUN needs to be set to 0
% before gametex.sty is loaded, so this processing has to be early.
% This generally means you need to \input this before your \documentclass.

% By default, do every PC.
