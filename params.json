  "body": "# Gameki Tools\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nCommand-line tools useful for writing/running LARPs based on [GameTeX](http://web.mit.edu/kenclary/Public/Guild/GameTeX/). Used for the backend of [Gameki](http://xavidotron.github.io/ep_gameki/), but can also be used directly with an ordinary GameTeX repo.\r\n\r\n### Tools Included\r\n\r\n* `casting`: Generate an interactive webpage for casting based on a csv of app responses (from, e.g., Google Forms).\r\n* `mail`: Mail out casting/costuming hints or packets based on GameTeX templates.\r\n* `prod`: Convenience script to prod sheets and such with GameTeX. Uses [latexmk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/) to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.\r\n* `book`: Typeset a packet as a foldable booklet.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* Text output depends on accurate conversion between TeX characters/tokens and\r\n  Unicode. For unusual characters and formatting, this is not yet\r\n  implemented.\r\n* Several tools are powered by LuaTeX, which may have some slight differences\r\n  from pdfTeX/XeTeX. Reported issues include:\r\n  * File names for fonts can't have spaces in them.\r\n",
