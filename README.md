# Gameki Tools

## About

Command-line tools useful for writing/running LARPs based on [GameTeX](http://web.mit.edu/kenclary/Public/Guild/GameTeX/). Used for the backend of [Gameki](http://xavidotron.github.io/ep_gameki/), but can also be used directly with an ordinary GameTeX repo.

### Tools Included

* `casting`: Generate an interactive webpage for casting based on a csv of app responses (from, e.g., Google Forms).
* `mail`: Mail out casting/costuming hints or packets based on GameTeX templates.
* `prod`: Convenience script to prod sheets and such with GameTeX. Uses [latexmk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/) to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
* `book`: Typeset a packet as a foldable booklet.
